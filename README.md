# Picture-Message-Encoder
converts text input to greyscale or RGB image

## Ideas
- upload or input text
- converts (unicode and/or ASCII) to hex/8-bit value and assigns to colour channel (multiple methods with RGB)
- creates and displays image, can download too
- have reverse process programmed as well: test image compression effectiveness
